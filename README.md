# Event Dispatcher Test

The event dispatcher test is about creating a way to de-couple events and callbacks.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hautelook/event-dispatcher-test.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hautelook/event-dispatcher-test)

## Requirements

The cart sample uses Vagrant to provision and configure a Virtual Machine that satisfies all the dependencies for the code to work.

   * node.js 0.12 or higher

## Installation

   * Make sure you have a working internet connection.
   * Install npm packages by typing: `npm install`

Note: We expect installation to take only a few minutes to setup. If for any reason it is taking longer, please feel free to reach out to us. We are happy to [help](#support).

## Running Tests

After installation, confirm the tests are working:

```bash
$ npm test
```

The tests should complete without errors. The majority of the tests will be in a pending state.

## Code Layout

Here is a high level overview of the important files in this project:

   * `events.js` - the event dispatcher code.
   * `events.spec.js` - the Jasmine tests that define requirements for the event dispatcher.

## Challenge

The first scenario has been written for you. Please implement as many of the remaining scenarios in `events.js` as you can within the next 60 minutes. We are judging you on the simplicity of your design and the correctness of the code. Make whatever changes you want to the scenario implementations and source code to accomplish that goal. Do not worry if you cannot finish all of them. Find a good stopping point and send us what you have. We are excited to see it! Zip up the entire directory and email it back to us.
